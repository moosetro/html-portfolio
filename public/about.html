    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>After attending the University of Oregon, I acquired a degree in Architecture, with a minor in Business and Art History. I practiced architecture for several years before I found my way to teaching. While I thoroughly enjoy the craft of architecture, I believe teaching is where I am most useful to our society. After pursuing a dream to hike 2600 miles from Mexico to Canada, I returned to school where I acquired my Master of Arts in Teaching at Concordia University in Portland, Oregon. I moved to Whidbey Island to pursue the art of teaching in Oak Harbor, where I taught for two years. I have been teaching at Corbett High School since then.</p>

    <h2>I am from</h2>

    <p>by Roger Binschus</p>


    <p>
      I am from the last frontier and northern lights. </br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; Darkness that falls for months on end; </br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  Where moonlight shines softly upon the snow </br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  Until daylight wins the battle for the summer months. </br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I am from “It was your brother’s, but now it is yours.” </br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  “Fair enough” </br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  “Six of one, half a dozen of the other” </br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  And “You are not your brother’s keeper.” </br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I am from meat and potatoes </br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  Fruit suspended in afterschool Jell-O; </br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  Daily desserts dished up after dinner; </br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  And tubs of fudge delivered like clockwork on birthdays. </br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I am from exploring with excitement; </br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  Arguing and winning; </br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  Competing with siblings; </br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  And scouting for growth.</br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I am from the forest;</br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  Golden shadows at dusk;</br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  Dew drenched dome tents at dawn;</br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  And mountains inviting the conqueror.</br>
    </p>
    <p>
      I am from the collective</br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  “On my honor,” with the scouts;</br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  “Play from the heart,” with the jazz band;</br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  Basement parties in multi-colored socks.</br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  “Happiness only real when shared.”</br>
    </p>  
      
    <p>
      I am from then      And I am from now.</br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  Late nights reading tips for my future</br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  Fist pumps with blueberries</br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  Examining my experiences under a microscope</br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  Realizing that I am now “on the shoulders of giants”</br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp;  I have listened, and now I speak.</br>
    </p>  
      
    <p>
      What a journey!
    </p>  

    <p>
      What’s next?
